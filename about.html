          <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
          <p>Back in 2018, I got my first taste of coding. It was a beginner's course in HTML & CSS at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Even before our first lesson ended, I knew that I had found my passion. Little did I know, but this was the start of my incredible coding journey ... and my career change!</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards I went on to do a WordPress website creation course, as well as my first workshop - Rails Girls 2018. My first coding workshop was an amazing experience. Even though I was clueless about what was going on, I am so thankful to all the wonderful volunteers. It was incredible to see how a community offered their time to come together to help support others. I knew that I wanted to be a part of this industry and that one day too, I could volunteer myself.</p>
          <p>After the Rails Girls workshop, I attended my next workshops - NodeGirls 2018 and Muses 2019. Both were such incredible experiences, I decided I wanted a career change so I chose to study further.</p>
          <p>I ended up choosing to study through Coder Academy's GenTech Bootcamp. It is a 10-month, part-time course which I completed in January 2020. Attending a Bootcamp was challenging at times, but I loved every minute of it. I enjoyed being part of a supportive team environment and met some amazing people!</p> 
          <p>During our course, we learnt the Command Line, Git, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the MERN stack. We also learned project management skills. The course has a very hands-on approach, which made it a wonderful learning experience.</p>
          <p>For our assessments, we completed a Portfolio Website, a Ruby Terminal App, a Two-Sided Marketplace using Ruby
            on Rails and a MERN app for a client (please see my <a href="projects.html" title="Link to my Projects page">Projects</a> page).</p>
          <p>After completing my course I went on to intern at Queensland Urban Utilities. It was such a fantastic experience being able to contribute to real projects. I got to learn so much each day and I was so lucky to be part of their amazing team culture!</p>
          <p>Fast-forward to today ... here I am, so grateful that I went on this journey and that I get to pursue my passion every day!</p>

          <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
          <p>I have had a range of jobs across many industries (<em>and</em> in three
            different countries!). It might have taken a while, but I can finally say that I’ve found my calling – it's
            coding!</p>
