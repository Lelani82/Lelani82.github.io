          <h2>Ruby Assessment</h2>
          <p>Our first assessment was a Ruby Terminal App. I created it together with my classmate Jamie. Here's a photo
            of us presenting our app to the class:</p>
          <div class="card" id="image-card">

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Our app is a shopping list where you can add items and quantities. You can select a category for each of
            your items. You have an option to view your current shopping list as well. When you're done, you can view
            your final shopping list and everything's sorted by category.</p>
          <p>Looking back I am amazed that we managed to design and build our app in only two days. It was a wonderful
            experience and I learnt so much. My favourite part besides coding was doing pair-programming.</p>

          <h2>Ruby on Rails Assessment</h2>
          <p>Our third assessment was a Two-Sided Marketplace App using Ruby on Rails. I created it together with
            Rachel, another one of my classmates. Here's a screenshot of our Home page:</p>

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Our app allows a user to buy or sell high-end used shoes. Shoes are categorised by Boots, Flats, Heels
            and Trainers.</p>
          <p>To date, this is the second-largest project that I have worked on. I enjoyed the project management and
            wireframe creation. My favourite part was using the Agile Methodology.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript API Hackathon</h2>
          <p>After learning Vanilla JavaScript we had a class hackathon. We had an opportunity to create a website using API's. Together with two of my classmates, we created the Tony Time Website.</p>

          </div>
          <p>It is a cocktail selection website where you can search for cocktails by name or ingredient. The name is in honour one of our amazing friends, Tony. He is such an incredible, kindhearted individual and we always have a fun, happy time when he's around.</p>
          <p>We spent two days on the hackathon creating the website. Our team also ended up winning the hackathon which was a wonderful experience!</p>

          <h2>MERN Assessment</h2>
          <p>Our final assessment was the AnalyzeVit App which we created for a client.</p>

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>It's based on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). We had to go find our client and create an app to their specifications.</p>
          <p>Our client wanted an app where a user could compare the vitamin content with others on the market. To date, this is the largest project that I have worked on. It was an opportunity to use all the knowledge that we had gained throughout our course.</p>

          </div>
          <p>We created a website for the community to register if they wanted someone to call them for a chat. We also created a chatbot app which helps you build better relationships with those close to you. You can find the download to our app on the homepage.</p>
          <p>Our team managed to make it into the top 10 of the mental health group. It was a wonderful opportunity to give back and contribute to a meaningful cause.</p>
