## A Description of my Portfolio Website


### The Purpose of my Portfolio Website

The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase my current skills to both future employers and clients. It is also a great platform to share a bit about myself and my coding journey.


### My Websites Functionality / Features 

I have included the following in my portfolio website:

● Links to my GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles (These are accessible from the footer on every page).

● An 'About' page which is all about my current studies at Coder Academy as well as the Tech Stacks I have learnt so far. I have also included any relevant past experience and qualifications and a list of all the workshops I have attended.  

● A 'Projects' page which has some information on our Ruby Terminal App Assessment. I have included a photo and a link to my GitHub Repo.

● A 'Contact' page which has a form for anyone who would like to contact me.


### My Websites Sitemap

Here's a sitemap of my website:

### My Websites Target Audience

My target audience would be anyone I wish to show my portfolio to. I can use it to showcase my current skills and abilities as well as any past projects I have completed. This would include any potential future employers and even clients, if I chose to do freelancing.

### Tech Stack that I Used

● HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

As per W3C recommendations, I used HTML5 for the structure and layout of my web pages.  

● CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

As per W3C recommendations, I used CSS3 for the styling of my web pages. 

● SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet)

I used Sass, an extension of CSS, to create my style sheets. I found it extremly helpful and noticed how much quicker I was able to create, edit and test all of my code.<br>
I was able to use variables which sped up the process of changing fonts and colours. I found having an understanding of Ruby definitely helped with understanding how variables are created and implemented.<br>
I used modularisation to seperate my files. This helped to keep my code organised and DRY. 

● GITHUB (Github Deployment)

I chose to use GitHub Pages to deploy my site. I found it helpful that I was able to simply push my commits and it would automatically update my website.

● JS (JavaScript) 

I only used a small bit of JavaScript in my website. It was to create a function for the hamburger menu. The function allows the user to toggle between showing and hiding the drop-down menu links whenever it is clicked on. I put the JavaScript code in its own file and linked it at the bottom of each of my HTML pages.

## My Design Documentation


### The Design Process
I designed my website using a responsive, mobile first design. This made me realise that it would be better to create a grid-container for each page and to use flexbox for each of the inner divs. Once my entire mobile site was completed, I was then able to focus on my Media Queries for larger screens.

### My Websites Mood Board

Colours selected blues, purples
Opted for a darker, more sophisticated and professional tone
Typography - selected Merriweather as main font type and Montserrat

### Usability Considerations for My Website

● Simple language Considerations: - used Hemingway Editor

● Bigger Font, buttons & icons Considerations:

● One topice per page Considerations:

● Quick load time Considerations: compressed images - used chromes Lighthouse auditing tool

● Multi browser & devices(screens) Considerations:

● Screen readers Considerations: - used alt on images. used otranscribe/ windows narrator/ mac voiceover

## Design Process:
##Trello
Broke up tasks into Trello board with time estimates (update daily with README)
## Timeline
Did a timeline to break up my days and dedicate different tasks to days.
Project management - one day
Design - one day
Each Webpage - one day for each to build, design, test
Powerpoint Presentation - one day
Spell Check - one day
Friday - Completion date - finalize everything including README
Extra Day in case

Originally wanted to do 1 page per day and test from there but ended up doing all mobile template layouts first, testing and then moving onto media queries & larger screens - way better ->
My original design was to build, test and create media queries for one page per day. I soon realised that it would be better to rather focus on creating template layouts for each page first. After I knew roughly what was going onto each page, I was able to focus on building my first page and test it. Once my first page was built it was really quick to create the next pages



## Wireframes
Compeleted wireframes. 1 for home for mobile and desktop. 1 for projects for mobile and desktop.

## Usability considerations
Dark background with lighter text, easier on the eyes
Font type easy to read
Include alt for images for screenreaders
Easy navigation for mobile - less is more
1 topic per page to help search engine optimusation
