## A Description of my Portfolio Website


### The Purpose of my Portfolio Website

The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase my current skills to both future employers and clients. It is also a great platform to share a bit about myself and my coding journey.


### Functionality / features 

I have included the following in my portfolio website:

● Links to my GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles (These are accessible from the footer on every page).

● An 'About' page which is all about my current studies at Coder Academy as well as the Tech Stacks I have learnt so far. I have also included any relevant past experience and qualifications and a list of all the workshops I have attended.  

● A 'Projects' page which has some information on our Ruby Terminal App Assessment. I have included a photo and a link to my GitHub Repo.

● A 'Contact' page which has a form for anyone who would like to contact me.
